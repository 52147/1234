## Text Parser

### Description
- The purpose of this exercise is to give you familiarity with Text Parsing, and Linked Lists. 
- You will read in a lengthy text file; Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray as text from guttenberg.org http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/174.txt.utf-8. 
- As you read the text you will map all words to lower case and remove all punctuation characters (Only numbers or letters should remain) removed characters should be eaten, NOT replaced with a space. 
- Once the words are pre-processed you will insert them into a Linked List. 

-  Solve these questions in your program :

     1. How many times do the following words appear in the text?
 
         a. portrait  

         b. persian  

         c. dorian  

         d. experimental  

         e. magnetic  
         
     2. How many entries are in the Linked List?
     
     3. Which words occur more than 20 times, and how many times do they occur?
     
     4. Which word occurs most frequently?
     
     5. Which word is the longest in the book?
     
     6. Which word occurs before the word “irritating” (in the linked list)?

### Requirements
1. No User Interface is required for this project.  
2. Download the text file to your local machine. Use BufferedReader to read the file.  
3. Although a regular expression may appear to be the best way to parse the text, a straight forward character by character analysis might be more appropriate.  
4. Write a program to open the text file and display it verbatim before you start adding it to the Linked List
5. Include a counter in each node to handle duplicate words.
